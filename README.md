## 🧠 Overview

This work proposes a **hybrid image encryption scheme** that combines:
- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** via the E91 protocol
- **Lorenz chaos-based encryption** implemented on FPGA

🔒 The system:
- Uses QKD to generate secure initial keys
- Perturbs Lorenz system parameters with QKD keys
- Encrypts image pixels in real-time at the **physical layer** using **FPGA**
- Achieves post-quantum security by resisting both classical and quantum attacks

---

## 📦 Dataset

- Uses 512×512 RGB bitmap images as input
- Initial QKD keys are simulated via Qiskit (E91 protocol)
- Encrypted and decrypted image samples are saved as BMP files

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- Lorenz attractor trajectories (Python)
- Encrypted/decrypted image comparisons
- Histogram & correlation analysis before and after encryption

| Original | Encrypted | Decrypted |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| ✅ RGB Image | 🔐 Encrypted Output | 🔓 Restored Image |
